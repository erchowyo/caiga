##Computer-Aid Interactive Grain Analyser##

This is my personal graduation project for bachelor degree. This application is free and open-source to everyone. 

You can use this application to calculate grain size number which is defined in ASTM E112-13 (both planimetric and intercept procedure are implemented). The segmentation is based on watershed combined with automatically seeds generating.

--------

##Features##

1. Grain size number (G) calculation by planimetric and intercept procedures
1. Area, perimeter, diameter, area percentage, flatenning calculation
1. Interactive segmentation
1. Support two or more phases or constituents
1. Count-diameter bar charts
1. Generate and output report in varies of formats such as PDF and ODF
1. Platform-Cross

----------

##Build Requirement##

- Qt >= 5.3.0
- OpenCV >= 2.4.8 (suggest 2.4.9)
- C++ compiler which supports C++11 (suggest MSVC 2013 and GCC 4.8)

##Run Requirement##

- Qt >= 5.3.0
- OpenCV >= 2.4.8
- Windows XP or later. or latest Linux distributions. other UNIX-like platforms are untested.
